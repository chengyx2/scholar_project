          <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
          <p>In recent monthes, many giant companies like google, amazon, meta had laid off for thousands of their employees. A lot of them are data-related positions, such as data analyist, data scientist, or machine learning engineer. The influx of them into the market has made it even more difficult for us to find jobs in a market that already has limited demand. Thus, its more important to seek job efficiently, and I will use data to help explain how to find jobs efficiently in this website</p>

Therefore, it is important to carefully consider various factors such as the job market, industry trends, and personal priorities when deciding on a job location.

  <p> The industry trend for different locations can significantly varied, which can greatly affect the job seeking process. You can't expect you will have lot of opportunities related to data science in Wyoming! Thus, if we are seeking the jobs like data scientist or data analyist, we first need to find out which state will offer the most opportunities, which implies we will have greater chance to find a job at that place. In the all of rest analysis, the data-realted jobs includes big-data and cloud computing field,block chain field,dataanalyst, data scientist, deep learning field, machine learning field, natural language processing field , neural networks field,reinforcement learning field</p>

      <p> It's indispensible to focus on element of companies for job seeking process. There are hundreds and thousands companies offere jobs for data-related works. Some of them are start-ups and some of them are giant companies and Microsoft and Googles. If we spend too much time on companies that no longer offer jobs it will be super time consuming and frustrating. I will still use the data posted on 04-14 for all data-related jobs nationalwide for analysis.</p>

    <div id="contentframe" style="position:relative; top: 160px; left: 0px;"></div>

          <center><figcaption>Figure 2: The distribution of data-related jobs in different companies</figcaption></center>
        </div>
        <br>
    <p>The Figure 2 lists top 10 companies that released most job positions related to data. It's noticable that the opportunities for giant companies is stabled but also means extreamly competitive. The No.1 company in this graph is a start-up company and lot of companies on this graph are also start ups. Besides, those start up companies wouldn't face that extreamly competition and thus have more chances to get hired. Thus, under current market situation, it seems to be a good strategy to find more start-up companies.</p>
    <div id="contentframe" style="position:relative; top: 160px; left: 0px;"></div>

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>The Figure 3 also prove the statemnt under Figure 2. For almost each position related to data. The supply from giant companies like Google, Apple, and Walmart are stable but competitive. While the job supply from start-up like Arisen Corportion, Up-work are also not bad and less competitive. Thus seeking data-related job from start-up companies seems to be a more wise choice, and it also deserves more focus.</p>

              <p>Various of platform (medium) takes an indispensible roles in job seeking process. Almost all companies post their job information and requirement on those platform. Thus, choosing the right platform also help us from finding a job</p>

    <section id="platform">
     <p>Using a single job medium exclusively can lead to extremely inefficient job seeking. Thus, we need to identify which platforms or mediums different companies prefer to use when posting job openings for different positions. Once we understand the underlying patterns, it will greatly benefit our job seeking process.</p>

        </div>
    <br>
    <p>Some people only uses medium like Linkedin or hand-shake for seeking jobs (like me), however, from Figure 4 it shows only data analyist job has most posts via Linkedin, while other jobs like big data computation and machine learning prefer more on ZipRecruiter and StartUp. Thus, this graph plays an very important indicator for finding jobs, people can refer to this chart to identify the most suitable platform for the job positions they wish to apply for.</p>

    <p>The Figure 5 indicates the data-related jobs require "Data" and "Experience" most, the data may imply the data science tuition and view. The Experience may imply the project experience on how to analyze, build model by data. Thus, in order to become more competitive in data-related jobs, we should gain more experience on doing more projects that not limited by our courses, but should find them online. The data intuitive and solution mentioned in graph is also important. Because the companies provide data job opportunities with the intention of allowing employees to utilize their expertise in data science viewe and tuition to help increase company benefit, it is particularly important during the hiring process to cultivate a unique perspective for problem-solving and proficiency in "data science" view.</p>
